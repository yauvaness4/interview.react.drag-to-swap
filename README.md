This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Popsa.com - React Frontend test skeleton

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

Reasons for approach:
- using dndkit library as it seemed to be the closest fit for the functionality required
- saves time, comes with accessibility out of the box

How I would improve this:
- Write unit/end to end integration tests for the handleDragEnd function
- Convert to TypeScript
